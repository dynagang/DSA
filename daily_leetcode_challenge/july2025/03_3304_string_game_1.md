# String Game Pattern - Find Kth Character

## Problem Understanding
Alice starts with "a" and repeatedly appends the "next character" version of the current string.
- Generation 0: "a"
- Generation 1: "a" + "b" = "ab"  
- Generation 2: "ab" + "bc" = "abbc"
- Generation 3: "abbc" + "bccd" = "abbcbccd"

## Key Observations

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Exponential Growth**: String length doubles in each operation
2. **Binary Structure**: Each position can be traced back through binary representation
3. **Character Transformation**: Each "level back" increases character by 1

### Critical Insight
The character at position k depends on:
- How many times we "went back" to find the original position
- Each "go back" operation increments the character

## Solution Strategies

### 1. Brute Force Approach
**Strategy**: Build the entire string until we have k characters
```python
# Simulate the actual game process
word = ['a']
while len(word) < k:
    next_chars = [chr(ord(c) + 1) for c in word]
    word.extend(next_chars)
return word[k-1]
```

**Complexity**: 
- Time: O(k) - need to generate k characters
- Space: O(k) - store the entire string

### 2. Optimal Bit Manipulation
**Strategy**: Use binary representation to trace back to original position
```python
# Count how many levels we go back
offset = 0
pos = k
while pos != 1:
    # Find largest power of 2 â‰¤ pos
    bit_pos = pos.bit_length() - 1
    if (1 << bit_pos) == pos:
        bit_pos -= 1
    pos -= (1 << bit_pos)
    offset += 1
return chr(ord('a') + offset)
```

**Complexity**:
- Time: O(log k) - binary search-like process
- Space: O(1) - only counters

### 3. Mathematical Optimization
**Strategy**: Direct bit counting
```python
# Key insight: offset = number of 1s in binary(k-1)
offset = bin(k-1).count('1')
return chr(ord('a') + offset % 26)
```
