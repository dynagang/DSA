## Problem Understanding

Alice types characters but may hold keys too long, causing repetition. We need to find how many original strings (≥ k length) could produce the given typed string.

## Solution Breakdown with Example

Let's use `word = "aabbccdd"`, `k = 7`

### Step 1: Run-Length Encoding
```
"aabbccdd" → segments: [aa, bb, cc, dd] → counts: [2, 2, 2, 2]
```

### Step 2: Calculate Total Combinations
Each segment of length `c` can be reduced to 1, 2, ..., c characters in the original string.
```
Total combinations = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16
```

### Step 3: Key Insight - Transform the Problem
Instead of counting valid strings directly, we:
1. Count **all possible** combinations
2. Subtract **invalid** combinations (length < k)

### Step 4: Transform to "Extra Characters" Problem
- Minimum original length = 4 (one char per segment)
- To reach length k=7, we need at least 3 extra characters
- Let `seg[i]` = max extra characters from segment i = `count[i] - 1`
- `seg = [1, 1, 1, 1]` (can add 0 or 1 extra from each segment)

### Step 5: DP to Count Invalid Combinations

```python
# dp[i] = number of ways to use exactly i extra characters
dp = [0] * 3  # k - seg_len = 7 - 4 = 3
dp[0] = 1     # base case: 0 extra chars
```

**Processing each segment:**

**Segment 0 (can add 0 or 1 extra):**
```
prefix_sum = [1, 0, 0]  # cumulative sum of dp
For i=0: dp[0] = prefix_sum[0] = 1
For i=1: dp[1] = prefix_sum[1] = 0  
For i=2: dp[2] = prefix_sum[2] = 0
Result: dp = [1, 0, 0]
```

**Segment 1 (can add 0 or 1 extra):**
```
prefix_sum = [1, 1, 1]  # cumulative sum of current dp
For i=0: dp[0] = prefix_sum[0] = 1
For i=1: dp[1] = prefix_sum[1] - prefix_sum[-1] = 1 - 0 = 1
For i=2: dp[2] = prefix_sum[2] - prefix_sum[0] = 1 - 1 = 0
Result: dp = [1, 1, 0]
```

**Segment 2:**
```
prefix_sum = [1, 2, 2]
For i=0: dp[0] = 1
For i=1: dp[1] = 2 - 1 = 1  
For i=2: dp[2] = 2 - 2 = 0
Result: dp = [1, 1, 0]
```

**Segment 3:**
```
prefix_sum = [1, 2, 2]
Final dp = [1, 1, 0]
```

### Step 6: Calculate Final Answer
```
invalid = sum(dp) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
But we want combinations with < 3 extra chars, so invalid = 11
valid = total - invalid = 16 - 11 = 5
```

Wait, let me recalculate this more carefully...

## Correct Dry Run

Let me trace through the actual optimized code:

```python
word = "aabbccdd", k = 7
seg = [1, 1, 1, 1]  # extra chars possible from each segment
seg_len = 4         # number of segments
k = 7 - 4 = 3       # extra chars needed beyond minimum
```

The DP counts ways to use **exactly** 0, 1, 2 extra characters (< 3):

After processing all segments:
- `dp[0]` = ways to use 0 extra chars = 1 way
- `dp[1]` = ways to use 1 extra char = 4 ways  
- `dp[2]` = ways to use 2 extra chars = 6 ways

Invalid combinations = 1 + 4 + 6 = 11
Valid combinations = 16 - 11 = 5 ✓

## Pattern Recognition

This is a **Bounded Knapsack DP with Sliding Window Optimization** pattern:

### When to use this pattern:
1. **Grouping + Constraints**: Problems involving consecutive identical elements with length constraints
2. **Combinatorial Counting**: Count valid arrangements/combinations
3. **Complementary Counting**: When direct counting is hard, count invalid cases and subtract

### Similar Problem Types:
1. **String Reconstruction**: Given compressed/encoded string, find original possibilities
2. **Sequence Generation**: Generate sequences with specific constraints
3. **Partition Problems**: Partition arrays/strings with size constraints
4. **Coin Change Variants**: Limited coins of each type with exact/minimum amounts

### Key Optimization - Sliding Window:
Instead of nested loops (O(n²)), we use prefix sums and sliding window to achieve O(n) per segment.

```python
# Instead of: for each position, check all previous positions
# We use: maintain a sliding window sum of valid previous states
```

## Code Structure Pattern:
1. **Encode/Group** input into manageable segments
2. **Calculate total** combinations without constraints  
3. **Transform constraint** into a DP subproblem
4. **Use sliding window** DP for efficiency
5. **Subtract invalid** from total

This pattern appears frequently in competitive programming for counting problems with constraints!

        for seg_len in segments:

        invalid = sum(dp) % MOD
        return (total - invalid + MOD) % MOD
